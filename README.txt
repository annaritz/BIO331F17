Running group_proj_331.py

The purpose of this code is indicated at the top of the file.

Make sure that all files to be analyzed are in the same file folder as group_proj_331.py

When running main, change the interactome variable to be whatever text file interactome you are analyzing, and change the positives variable to be a text file of positive regulators for that genome.

All input types are indicated with respective functions, as well as what they take for input in general. All functions are also commented with how the function works at almost every line.

This code will take hours to run because of the SteinerApprox function.


Running post_processing.py

The purpose of this code is to produce output files from input obtained from the main file. It was also used for testing output functions separately from the main code. 

NOTE:
"tree_nodes.txt" and "tree_edges.txt" will be different each time because we are using a Steiner tree approximation.
